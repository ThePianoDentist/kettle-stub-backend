# communiTEA stub

hacked to be super simple and just work for one kettle.

could run across multiple kettles, so long as tie user-id to kettle-id by "signing in" to smart-kettle which has a specific device-id

the weird "return status code 200 + num_drinkers" is due to my wifi chip behaving weirdly. and i can reliably read status codes, but not response bodies.
